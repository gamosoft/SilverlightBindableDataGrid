# Silverlight Bindable DataGrid

New control extending the Silverlight DataGrid to enable an easier use of binding objects with DataSource instead of ItemsSource.

This is a new Silverlight DataGrid control that allows the user to bind data in a traditional .Net way.

Please read the migrated docs for more information until I have time to arrange the README.md file. :-)

You can download the compiled binaries here in the meantime:
